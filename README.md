AUV GNC: Guidance, Navigation, and Control for AUVs
===============================================================

## Overview
Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) are three of the biggest challenges that all robots face, let alone autonomous robots. From unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to self-driving cars to autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), every one of these types of robots must be capable of localizing, navigating, and guiding itself in an unknown environment, and also be capable of controlling its own movements. This library is specifically targeted at AUVs.

Finding an opensource "GNC-like" library for AUVs used to be a struggle, until now. AUVs are becomming increasingly popular, yet there never seemed to exist a solid GNC platform from which anyone can build off of. The purpose of this library is to do just that. AUV GNC is a C++ library composed of multiple catkin packages containing with (almost) all of the code needed to start working with an AUV.
